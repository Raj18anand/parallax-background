Build with HTML/CSS and pure vanilla Javascript.

Used Javascript classes and made objects for every background images that is used. Properties and behaviours were same for every image, only value for those were different, thus chose to use classes for this. 

The HTML <canvas> element is used to draw graphics via JavaScript. The <canvas> element is only a container for graphics.

- The <canvas> element defines a bitmapped area in an HTML page.
- The Canvas API allows JavaScript to draw graphics on the canvas.
- The Canvas API can draw shapes, lines, curves, boxes, text, and images, with colors, rotations, transparencies, and other pixel manipulations.

The HTML <canvas> element itself has no drawing abilities.
Used JavaScript to draw any graphics.
The getContext() method returns an object with tools (methods) for drawing.

The getContext() function is used to access the 2D drawing functions of the canvas tags. It takes one parameter, the type of context. For 2D graphics, the parameter is "2d".

Different methods used to draw animations:
- The clearRect() method in the Canvas 2D API erases pixels in a rectangular area by setting them to transparent black. The clearRect() method does not change the current path.
- The drawImage() method draws an image, canvas, or video onto a canvas. It can also draw parts of an image, and/or increase/reduce the image size.
